# Flutter-App-With-Authentication-using-Firebase
This is a Simple Flutter App demostrating the integration and use of Firebase as Backend. Here I have only used authentication provided by the Firebase.
[See this](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-auth-in-flutter-apps#0) for tutorial.
## Note
- There are some keys and IDs that are used in app but are not exposed as they are project specific and may be sensitive.
- As of now FlutterFire is deprecated and it is recommended to shift to new packages available at pub. [See this](https://pub.dev/packages/flutterfire_ui#:~:text=FlutterFire%20UI%20is,firebase_ui_database).
