# Flutter-App-With-Authentication-using-Firebase
This is a Simple Flutter App demostrating the integration and use of Firebase as Backend. Here I have only used authentication provided by the Firebase.  
## Note
There are some keys and IDs that are used in app but are not exposed as they are project specific and may be sensitive.
